# network_viz
Project 2 for networking class.

### Graph 1 - Grep & Js
* For a simple and quick calculation of each type, `grep` was used.
* Open Terminal, and run each of the grep command (or run them all) and the final results will
be printed.
* Based on the numbers, 1 is subtracted from each due to the header.
* Each of these is calculated to get the percentage (#'s / total) and applied to the graph_objs
* The graph is very simple and straight forward. Open the graph1.html file to see.

### Python
* This was a nice python script that will grab the data, search through and produce the graph all at once
``` python proj2_graph1_draft.py ```

And a new window will open with the graph.


### The rest
``` python project.py ```
Once run, it will produce 2 .txt files

### TODO:
Still need to create table and graphs and write observation for the project
